 A copy of UltimaSDK's repository from codeplex

Project Description
The Ultima SDK is a Software Development Kit for the game Ultima Online*. This DLL allows developers to easily translate art-work and process information from the game's data and executable files. The DLL was written by RunUO-Core Developer krrios and is here-by maintained by the community. This repository was created to maintain a centralized source for contribution..

This release contains a compilation of contributions from many members of the RunUO-Team and RunUO-Community. I took the time to sit down and combine all possible contributions found at runuo.com and even included some of my own.
